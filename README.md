Final changes were made to account for outliers. Missing values were also filled in. The application on Render is built to filter based off automatic transition type compared to others. 

General conclusion: The project showed me how to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service such as Render, so my application could be viewed by the public. The data set used involved car sales advertisements. To display differences between car manufacturers, we extracted the first word in the model columns string and assigned it to a new column within the dataframe labeld manufacturer. Medians for the odometer, cylinder, and model year were placed over NaN values. Furthermore, the Interquartile Range method is used to remove outliers to have a better display on graphs. In summary, I enjoyed this process
in devloping a web application and now have a better understanding of web applications.
