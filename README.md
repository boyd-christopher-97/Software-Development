Final changes were made to account for outliers, and missing values were also filled in. The application on Render is built to filter based on automatic transition type compared to others. 

General conclusion: The project showed me how to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service such as Render so the public could view my application. The data set used involved car sales advertisements. To display differences between car manufacturers, we extracted the first word in the model columns string and assigned it to a new column within the data frame labeled manufacturer. Medians for the odometer, cylinder, and model year were placed over NaN values. Furthermore, the Interquartile Range method removes outliers to have a better display on graphs. From the histogram of price vs condition, it was transparent prices would increase
if conditions were comparable to new. In summary, I enjoyed developing a web application; I now understand web applications better.
